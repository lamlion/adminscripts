# badapps

If you are a school IT admin, you have probably told your students not use certain apps (e.g. VPN and Torrenting apps), but of course students dont listen and they download them. 

With this `badapps`, you can feed it a file with a list of bundle identifiers of the app that you dont allow and it will delete off the student's computer. 

Dont have the bundle identifier of an app? No problem! Just use the `--get-id` option and either give it the name of the app or the path to the app
